## Instructions
The idea is simple: you mix up a Rubik's cube. You show the cube to your computer's webcam. Some magic happens, and your cube appears onscreen. Then the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow along and you will have solved your cube!

Here we provide a [video](http://player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=76684072&cid=131158836&page=1) to introduce the capabilities of Cube Solver. 

In the aspect of Rubik's cube solution, we choose Two Phase Algorithm (also called Kociemba Algorithm). You can visit [here](http://kociemba.org/cube.htm) to learn more about the solution details.

In conclusion, compared with other online Rubik's cube solving web pages, our highlights are: 

1. Support multiple input modes: scanning, coloring and rotation sequence. 
2. The demonstration process of Rubik's cube solution supports the use of progress bar. 
3. Offline saving is supported in the demonstration process of Rubik's cube solution.
